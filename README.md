# Final Course Project: Analyzing Spotify Songs

This is a project for the course Massive Processing of Data (CC5212) using Apache Pig and Hadoop.

First, we got our data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeanpierrrerio/spotify-dataset-1921-2020-160k-tracks

Download data and do some preprocessing using Python Pandas Dataframes:
See spotify_preprocessing.ipynb

Using Hadoop, load our samples and execute the pig scripts.
